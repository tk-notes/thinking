About Challenges & Changes

- It's good because you are moving from your comfort zone
- It's bad because you need control your anxiety
- I feel I need to close my eyes to all new stuff going on and embrace the good parts

- You need to keep learning. And trying your best to follow.
- Seek for context and ask many questions for many people.
