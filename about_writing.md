# About writing

## Ideas

- Write down some ideas that pop to my mind through the day - notion app (notes-like)
- Keep an "editorial" of things I want to write about - notion app (trello-like)

## Drafts

- Write down some topics: "sub headers" for the whole article
- Reasearch + Studies + Tests + Personal Opinions
- Sit down & focus only on my post for hours
- Personal: I like to LoFi music in background

## Edition / Revision

- Share with few people from community
- Review by myself
    - Did I understand what I wrote?
    - Is it the best way to express the idea?
    - Revision with Grammarly
    - Should I draw? Should I add more images?
