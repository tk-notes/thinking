# Understanding my why

## **Why?**

I think I have 3 main points:

- **Culture**: When a company gives to you autonomy and ownership to be you and do the your best work. And when I think of a great culture, I actually think of a group of great people. And when you work with great people, you always learn together, and do an amazing job.
- **Personal and professional growth**: I always like to feel that I'm learning with tough problems and challenges.
- **Impact and purpose**: I think this is one of the most important things in my life. I need to know that my work is really impacting people's lives. To have a purpose is what moves me in my day-to-day life.

## **What do you think of functional programming? Are you interested in it?**

I like the concepts of functional programming and I'm studying it for like 1 month now. I wrote a blog post about an introduction to FP in Clojure and in Javascript. I also did a tech talk at Worldpackers explaining FP concepts.

## Talk about yourself and why you want to work with us. This is a chance for us to know more about you and your motivations.

I consider myself a lifelong learner, and everything I learn I love to share. So great people with tough technical and non-technical challenges are elements I always search for an environment I want to be. Along with this, I seek a big purpose. The "why" I am working at this company. And I want to impact as many people as I can.

## Write briefly about one thing you've done related to software engineering that you'd like to share with us. Could be projects - either personal, professional or academic, troubleshooting experiences, scaling issues, system outages.

I built a budget tool for travelers. The first thing was to scrape data from a travel website to get info about food, transportation, and accommodation by city. Then I parsed this data and stored this into the DB to show the info in the UI using an A/B test to measure how this would impact the conversion.

## How do you usually learn? Mention a few references that were important to you (books, presentations, articles, courses)

I like to read books and see videos. Then I would practice with online exercises or build a personal project. I also like to share my knowledge through my blog posts and talks.

One example was functional programming.

- I read the "Clojure for the brave and true" book
- Did some hacker rank exercises ([http://bit.ly/2UQOPvg](http://bit.ly/2UQOPvg))
- Built a personal project ([http://bit.ly/rachar-conta](http://bit.ly/rachar-conta))
- Wrote an FP post ([http://bit.ly/fp-principles-with-clojure](http://bit.ly/fp-principles-with-clojure))
- Did a talk about it to my work colleagues ([http://bit.ly/fp-talk](http://bit.ly/fp-talk))
